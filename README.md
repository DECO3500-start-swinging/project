# Study line Readme.md  
Due to the influence of COVID-19, many schools in the world have to switch to online teaching mode. However, due to the lack of the experience of online learning at home, the learning process and efficiency of many students have been greatly affected. If students spend a long time in a place where there is no learning atmosphere, no interaction between students, and no public cognitive pressure to face the electronic screen to carry out most of their learning activities, their enthusiasm for learning may be easily reduced and they are also more likely to be attracted by other interesting activities of entertainment. And most of the existing widely used online teaching platforms were designed to support online video conferences before, and will not have the function to improve this situation in a short time. As a result, we propose to achieve a learning progress sharing platform to improve the quality of online education by encouraging interaction between students.
